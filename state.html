	<h1>Here are my thoughts on Alaska's webpage.</h1>

	
	<p>Check out <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_new" title="Alaska"> Alaska</a>.</p>

	<p> Rank: 4 </p>

	<ul>

		<li>The page is very organized and easy to use. The page itself is very bland and ugly. </li>

		<li>It has many different link options that are all easy to click on.</li>

		<li>The page is not designed to fit your phones screen which is very annoying.</li>
		
		<li> I really like how it has public notices on the front page so they are easy to access. </li>
		<li> Another thing I really like about this website is that it offers different links so you can find information faster if your a visitor or a resident of the state. </li>

	<h1>Here are my thoughts on Arizona's webpage.</h1>

	<p> Rank: 1 (best)</p>

	<p>Check out <a href="https://az.gov/" target="_new" title="Arizona"> Arizona</a>.</p>

	

	

<p> </p>

	<ul>

		<li> My first thought right as I opened the website is that its very visually appealing.</li>

		<li>It has many different options for you to click depending on what you are looking for.</li>

		<li> It has many cool pictures of tourist desinations in Arizona. It also inculdes background information on these photos.</li>

		<li> It is easier to navitage then Alaskas website becuase it doesnt have as many links on the front page.</li>

		<li>I dont like how it doesn't have a notifications page to get annoucements out to the public.</li>

<h1>Here are my thoughts on Montana's webpage.</h1>

	<p>Rank: 3 </p>

	<p>Check out <a href="https://mt.gov/" target="_new" title="Montana"> Montana</a>.</p>

	


	<ul>

		<li>The first thing I enoyed on the website is the background photo of Long Lake. The quality is perfect and really makes the page stand out.</li>

		<li>Next, the news releases are right in the center of the page and are very visible for everyone. This is very helpful for those people who are just looking for some state news. </li>

		<li>This page is made to be able to fit your phone screen which is very helpful.</li>
		<li>One thing I don't like about this page is that it doens't have a place where vistors can search for fun things to do in montana.</li>
		<li> I would consider this one of the best pages ive seen so far and think that almost anyone could navigate this page if they wanted to. </li>

<h1>Here are my thoughts on Nebraska's webpage.</h1>

	<p> Rank: 2 </p>
	
	<p>Check out <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/" target="_new" title="Nebraska"> Nebraska</a>.</p>


	<ul>

		<li>The first thing that stood out is the statistics graph that sits right in the middle of the page. It gives statistics on labor and health in the state of Nebraska which is really neat. </li>

		<li> It has many links across the top of the page and a search tabe right smack in the upper middle part of the page. The designers made it very easy to navigate</li>

		<li>The overal design of the page is great. It gives off relaxing vibes due to some of the creative links going across the page.</li>
		<li> On the page there is also a link providing flooding and safety information to the public. This is very important because the community needs to know what do do in case of emergencies. 
	</ul>
	
	

<h1>Here are my thoughts on New Hampshire's webpage.</h1>

	

	

	<p>Check out <a href="https://www.nh.gov/index.htm" target="_new" title="New Hampshire"> New Hampshire</a>.</p>

	<p> Rank: 5 (worst) </p>

	<ul>

		<li>This is easily the ugliest page ive seen thus far. The colors and outline of the page could be totally redesigned to make it more desireable. </li>

		<li>The page is not coded to fit phone screens which is always an issue for cell phone users.</li>

		<li>I do like how they have frequently asked questions on the front page. This can make navigating the page easy and help the user find more relevent information.  </li>
		<li>It also has a search bar right in the middle of the page. One thing they could do to improve the layout of the page would be to center the search bar in the box. Its very ugly how they have it now.
