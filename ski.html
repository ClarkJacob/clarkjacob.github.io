	<p>White Pass, also known as the Dead Horse Trail, (elevation 873 m or 2,864 ft) is a mountain pass through the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains on the border of the U.S. state of Alaska and the province of British Columbia, Canada. The White Pass Trail is a unit of Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park, and with the Skagway Historic District makes up a National Historic Landmark. Parts of the historic White Pass trail can be seen from the Klondike Highway and the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad. Much of the old trail has been disturbed by the construction of wagon roads, railroads and highways; however, a portion of the original White Pass Trail used by stampeders in 1897-1899 is still in situ (left undisturbed) today. Most of the areas are difficult to reach, spread throughout the wilderness of the Skagway River valley and into the Yukon over the White Pass. It is not recommended that visitors attempt to hike or gain access to the original route, as it is not marked, maintained or currently used.</p>
