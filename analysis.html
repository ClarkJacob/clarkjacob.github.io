	<h1> Here is my first good webpage.</h1>

	
	<p>Check out <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_new" title="Tesla"> Tesla</a>.</p>

	<p>Tesla’s website definitely caught my eye from the moment I opened it. From the visually appealing website design, to the clear photos of their products, it does reign supreme. It stands out from other websites because of how interactive it is. You can customize the car of your dreams in a matter of minutes. As you scroll down the website, it provides more pictures and videos of the cars they sell which are all very visually appealing. Most of the websites code is up to date and very sophisticated to the point where I can only pick out the simple code. I did not see any tables but I’m sure they have some as you look for products to add to your car. The layout of the website is so easy I believe anyone could use it. The only scrolling effect on the page is when you scroll down the videos will start playing and stop as they get towards the top of the page. Navigation on this website is very simple. It gives you options to select what you want through the pictures or there is a tab in the top right corner. The colors on the website gives it a warm and inviting feeling. Also, most of the colors look like they are from nature giving it an eco-friendly feeling which is what they are aiming for. The curvy display icons really invite customers to make that next step and start looking deeper into the page. </p>

	
	

	<h1>Here is my second good webpage.</h1>


	<p>Check out <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_new" title="Apple"> Apple</a>.</p>

	<p> Another great website that I looked at was Apple. This webpage is also very visually appealing and makes their products stand out. As you scroll down the page it shows you all of their newest products or games. Each have their own picture and description or link. The picture of the new AirPods pro are so appealing it makes me want to purchase them every time I see the picture.There are no scrolling effects which was a little disappointing considering how big the company is. The code looks to be up to date and can see some things we use in class like src links. The navigation is great. It’s in the top left corner and lists all their products so you can just click on what you are looking for. After you choose your product. It takes you to another section on the web site that is just all about that product. It doesn’t try to sell you something your not looking for which is always very nice. The colors are dark but make the page look crisp and futuristic. This is exactly what apple is looking for since their products are held to a high standard and are always technologically advanced. </p>

	


<h1>Here are my thoughts on a bad webpage.</h1>

	
	<p>Check out <a href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_new" title="ESPN"> ESPN</a>.</p>

	<p>The website I was most disappointed in was ESPN. Their website made me feel very claustrophobic because of the number of new stories, ads and links to click on. Bother ever caught my eyes. Considering that ESPN makes a massive amount of money you would think they could make a website that didn’t feel like you were stuck in 2010. Every story I would click on to read always had ads below it and made it very difficult to stay focused on reading. As annoying as the website is, it does seem to have an easy navigation to use. It has all the sports to choose from in the top bar. The pictures are all very nice but don’t pull you away from having to look at the rest of the difficult website. This website also doesn’t work all the time like it should.I do use this website very frequently to get scores and play fantasy football so I notice when the website isn’t working correctly. The colors do add a nice look and warm feeling to the page. They are probably the only thing I like about the page. Red, black, white, and grey make it feel official. The code doesn’t look to be up to date. You can see src, href, and other basic codes. It’s also very advanced too. But I would definitely say this page is not very good. </p>
